# openQCM NEXT — raw sweep files (`sweep_data/`)

> Specification of the raw per-overtone sweep spectra produced during acquisition.
> Intended to be handed to a tool or an AI so the files can be parsed and
> manipulated correctly. Location on disk: `software/openQCM/sweep_data/`.

## What they are
`openQCM/sweep_data/<n>.txt` are the **raw per-overtone frequency-sweep spectra**
captured during a multiscan acquisition. Each file is the full amplitude + phase
response of one resonance vs. frequency — the un-fitted data from which the
software later extracts resonance frequency and dissipation (the values that end
up in `logged_data/*_multi.csv`).

Written by `openQCM/processors/Multiscan.py` via
`FileStorage.TXT_sweeps_save` (which calls `numpy.savetxt`).

## Filenames
`<n>.txt` where **n = 2·(overtone_index) + 1**, overtone_index = 0…4:

| file    | overtone index | harmonic          |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|
| `1.txt` | 0              | fundamental (1st) |
| `3.txt` | 1              | 3rd               |
| `5.txt` | 2              | 5th               |
| `7.txt` | 3              | 7th               |
| `9.txt` | 4              | 9th               |

> ⚠️ **These files are OVERWRITTEN on every acquisition cycle.** The name is fixed
> (no timestamp), so `sweep_data/` always holds only the **most recent** sweep of
> each overtone — it is a live snapshot, not a growing history. To keep a sweep,
> copy it out before the next cycle.

## File format
- **Plain text, no header, no index column.**
- **Whitespace-delimited** (single space), one sweep point per line.
- Every value in **scientific notation, full double precision** (`%.18e`,
  e.g. `4.986788000000000000e+06`). Decimal separator `.`.
- **Exactly 3 columns:**

| # | Column                | Unit    | Description                                                                 |
|---|-----------------------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | Frequency             | Hz      | sweep frequency; monotonically increasing, **1 Hz step**                    |
| 2 | Amplitude / Magnitude | dB      | AD8302 VMAG rescaled at 30 mV/dB, **attenuator not undone** — see below     |
| 3 | Phase channel         | degrees | AD8302 VPHS rescaled at 10 mV/deg — ⚠️ this is `90 − abs(Δφ)`, **not** the phase |

- **Number of rows: 18001** — the sweep spans an 18 kHz window around the detected
  resonance (`LEFT = 12000` Hz below … `RIGHT = 6000` Hz above, at 1 Hz step ⇒
  18000 + 1 points). The absolute frequency range differs per overtone
  (≈5 MHz for `1.txt`, ≈15 MHz for `3.txt`, ≈25 MHz for `5.txt`, etc.).

## How columns 2 and 3 were derived (units provenance)
The stored values are already physical (dB / degrees), converted from the 12-bit
ADC reading of the AD8302 (Vref = 3.3 V, 4096 counts, VCP = 0.9 V; AD8302 slopes
30 mV/dB and 10 mV/°):

```
ADCtoVolt      = 3.3 / 4096
amplitude_dB   = ( adc_mag   * ADCtoVolt / 2.0 - 0.9 ) / 0.03
phase_degrees  = ( adc_phase * ADCtoVolt / 1.5 - 0.9 ) / 0.01
```

⚠️ **Neither column is the physical quantity its name suggests.** Both are the
detector's own output rescaled, and each carries one thing that has to be undone
before the numbers mean anything outside a plot. Read the two warnings below
before using this data for impedance work — both have already cost a wrong
analysis.

### ⚠️ Column 3 is `90 − |Δφ|`, not the phase
The AD8302 has no sign output: it emits the **magnitude** of the phase difference,
**1.8 V at 0° and 0.9 V at 90°**. The conversion above subtracts 0.9 V, so what
lands in the file is

```
column3 = ( V_PHS - 0.9 ) / 0.01  =  90 - |delta_phi|      # degrees
|delta_phi| = 90 - column3                                 # what the detector measured
```

A file line reading `+12.04` does **not** mean 12° of phase: it means
`|Δφ| = 77.96°`. And the sign of Δφ is **not in the data** — it flips where the
true phase crosses zero, which is the *peak* of `V_PHS`.

### ⚠️ Column 2 is on the **uncompensated** scale
The formula above has **no attenuator term**: `<n>.txt` stores the divider level as
the ADC sees it, with the INPB R11/R19 attenuator still in it. That is fine for
finding a peak and wrong for computing an impedance — recover the volts and undo
it first:

```
V_MAG = 0.9 + column2 * 0.030            # volts at the ADC, uncompensated
V_MAG_corrected = V_MAG - 0.610692       # = 20*log10((47.0+4.99)/4.99) * 0.030
```

`0.610692`, **not 0.600**: the attenuator is 20.3564 dB, not one clean decade, and
the 0.3564 dB residue is not cosmetic — it understates the divider magnitude by
**4.02 %**, which an impedance inversion amplifies to **up to −22 %** on the
motional resistance at the fundamental in air.

A reader who only wants to *look* at the sweep does not need any of this: column 2
already rises at resonance and column 3 already dips there.

## Real example (first line of `1.txt`)
```
4.986788000000000000e+06 -1.378842773437500391e+01 1.203842773437498970e+01
```
→ frequency = 4 986 788 Hz, column 2 = −13.79, column 3 = +12.04.

Decoded: `V_MAG` = 0.9 − 13.788·0.03 = **0.4866 V** uncompensated
(− 0.6107 = **−0.1243 V** compensated), and `V_PHS` = 0.9 + 12.038·0.01 =
**1.0204 V**, i.e. **|Δφ| = 77.96°** — near the 90° the `C0` branch holds off
resonance, as expected for the first point of a sweep.

## Recommended handling
- Load with any whitespace-delimited numeric reader
  (`numpy.loadtxt`, `pandas.read_csv(sep=r'\s+', header=None)`); name the columns
  `["freq_Hz", "mag_ch", "phase_ch"]` — ⚠️ **not** `amplitude_dB` / `phase_deg`,
  which is what invites the two mistakes above.
- Treat each file as **one spectrum of one overtone**; do not concatenate across
  files (different frequency ranges).
- Do not assume the files persist — snapshot them if you need a specific cycle.
- To locate the resonance: the peak in column 2 (amplitude). Dissipation-type
  analysis uses the peak width/phase; the production pipeline fits these with
  Savitzky–Golay smoothing + spline (`sweep_data/plot_sweep_spline.py` is a
  reference viewer).

## Minimal parsing snippet (Python)
```python
import numpy as np

freq, mag_ch, phase_ch = np.loadtxt("openQCM/sweep_data/1.txt", unpack=True)

f_res = freq[np.argmax(mag_ch)]       # resonance ≈ peak of the magnitude channel

# only if you need physical quantities:
abs_dphi_deg = 90.0 - phase_ch                        # detector emits |delta phi|
v_mag        = 0.9 + mag_ch * 0.030 - 0.610692        # volts, attenuator undone
```

_Note: on the TEC-less TEST board the content of these files is identical (the
DDS/ADC sweep engine is unchanged); only the temperature field in the CSV logs is
simulated — the `sweep_data` spectra are unaffected._
