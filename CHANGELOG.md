# Changelog

Reconstruction of the openQCM NEXT development history. Format inspired by
Conventional Commits. Versions are marked by Git tags.

## [Unreleased] — `main`

### Added
- **Serial connection as a separate feature (Step 1)**: dedicated **Connect / Disconnect**
  button (in the Start/Stop row), decoupled from the operation-mode selection.
  - Multi-instance protection via a per-port lock file (`fcntl` on Unix, skipped on
    Windows where COM ports are natively exclusive).
  - On connect the port is validated (open/close probe) and the **firmware version
    check runs here** (moved from the blind call at application startup).
  - **START is now gated on an active connection** (`_enable_ui`), and the port
    combo box is disabled while connected. Connection status shown in `label_COM_status`.
  - Note: the persistent exclusive handle (`_serial_lock`), migration of the ~8 GUI
    serial queries, and the acquisition hand-off (release/re-acquire around START/STOP)
    are deferred to Step 2.

### Changed
- **Entry point unified into `run.py`**: added a thin `software/run.py` launcher and
  removed the duplicate root `software/app.py`; the `OPENQCM` class now lives only in
  `openQCM/app.py`. Launch with `python run.py` (or `python -m openQCM`).
- Firmware version check no longer runs automatically at startup; it runs on connect.

### Docs
- Rewrote `README.md` with a full structure (badges, TOC, features, architecture,
  version history, relationship to openQCM Q-1, roadmap), inspired by openQCM Q-1.

## [v0.1.6G-test] — branch `impedance-analysis` (from v0.1.6-dev)
- Alternative impedance analysis via **conductance spectrum G(f)** derived from
  the AD8302 MAG/PHASE signals (software post-processing, same firmware).
- Core in `processors/Multiscan.py`; offline script `sweep_data/plot_conductance.py`.
- Note: approximate formula; development/DEBUG state. Not production-ready.

## [v0.1.6-dev-073] — `main`
- GUI: buttons reorganized into an "Add-On" menu, Temperature/PID tab widget.
- Robustness: fallback when reading `PeakFrequenciesRT.txt`; exit confirmation.
- `data_view/main.py` refactor. Measurement logic unchanged.
- Firmware updated to **0.1.5a** (POT_VALUE 240, noise reduction).

## [v0.1.6-dev] — `main`
- **Automatic peak detection**: fundamental + overtones [3,5,7,9], auto-classifies
  the quartz @5MHz/@10MHz.
- **TEC current monitoring** (serial command "A").
- **Dark UI + real-time plot** performance (setData, 50 ms timer, TEC SecondWindow).
- Multi-start bugfix; Linux path separator fix.

## [v0.1.5] — `main`
- Production baseline, working and stable.
